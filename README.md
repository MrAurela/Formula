Kouluprojekti tietotekniikkaoppinnoissa: Ruutupohjainen autokilpailu, jossa tavoitteena on kiert√§ rata vastustajaansa nopeammin.

This project was done for a Computer Science course project at Aalto University.
It's a turn based 2 player car race video game. By cleverly managing the speed and direction of their vehicle the player must reach the goal before the opponent and avoid driving off the track.
